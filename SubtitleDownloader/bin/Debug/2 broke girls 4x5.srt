1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,450
I'm Max. I'll be your waitress,

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:05,250
'cause they don't do
background checks here.

3
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:07,840
Oh, you'll be our waitress.

4
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:09,642
I never guessed that
based on the uniform

5
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:13,479
and name tag that says "Max."

6
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:16,582
You know I make, like, $3, right?

7
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:18,818
I realize that's a lot
of money in the 1920s

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,587
where you two are from.

9
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:24,723
Here, open this and bring
us two clean glasses.

10
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:27,459
Sure, Not-so-great Gatsby.

11
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,063
Hey, OJ and Nicole.

12
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,201
Rude snobs at table ten.
You know what that means.

13
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,071
Wine swap? Let's roll.

14
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,175
Hey, Oleg, I need one
of those $2 merlots

15
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:46,211
you get from your cousin
with the hole in his neck.

16
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,713
Caroline, price check.

17
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:52,117
Oh! Chateau Pavie, 2008.
Very expensive.

18
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,752
But, hey, we deserve it.

19
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,722
Here, better let it breathe.

20
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,158
It was in my gym bag.

21
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,693
Not a problem.

22
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,630
This vintage pairs well with jockstrap.

23
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:07,266
Do you think waitresses did
this to me when I had money?

24
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,134
Only if you had an attitude.

25
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:12,037
- So that's a yes.
- So that's a yes.

26
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,139
I can't remember if this reminds me

27
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,676
of an old heist movie
I saw on an old heist

28
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:20,178
I actually participated in.

29
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,815
I know. We're like Ocean's 7/11.

30
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,584
All we're missing is a tiny asian guy

31
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,319
who can fit into small boxes.

32
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:30,388
Hello.

33
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,891
Table ten is looking for their wine.

34
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,694
Oh, not a problem. Coming right up.

35
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,430
What did you do? Why is she smiling?

36
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,800
Are my pants on fire again?

37
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:49,474

Oh, yeah, take that, sucker!

40
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:05,900
Max, when I said
we need to move the cupcakes,

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,890
I didn't mean through the
air at a rodent's head.

42
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,860
Hey, he ran up the window,

43
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,060
so it's kind of a
stand-your-ground situation.

44
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,770
Okay, we're on a time-out.
He's eating my ammo.

45
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,770
Max, business is down again,

46
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,600
and the only phrase I've
said more than that is,

47
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,970
"Please, god, take me in my sleep."

48
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,210
I mean, it's clear. Not getting ahead.

49
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,010
Oh, is that what your mood is about?

50
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,410
You're not getting any ahead?

51
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,750
'Cause I can take care
of that with one call.

52
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,320
You are not hooking me up with that guy

53
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,350
who's listed in your phone
as "Oral Redenbacher."

54
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,190
Max, this is our future.

55
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,360
We need to get serious
about making money.

56
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,760
Absolutely. Let's leave early.

57
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,170
Leave early? Who are we, congress?

58
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,330
Do you think other
business got successful

59
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,540
by leaving early?

60
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,370
No, they did it by hiring illegals

61
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,640
and moving their bank accounts offshore.

62
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,810
We can't leave early.

63
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,950
The sign says "open till 2:00 A.M."

64
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,120
Well, I'm open to getting a
new sign that says "closed."

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,950
I mean, are we supposed
to just hang around here

66
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,190
and wait for whatever nut
jobs are trolling around town?

67
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,160
Hi, girls.

68
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,290
Guess what Oleg and I are going to do

69
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,130
that will probably give me Hep C.

70
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,370
A three way with Tommy Lee?

71
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,300
No, silly. We're
getting matching tattoos.

72
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,240
We want something that
represents our relationship.

73
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,810
So maybe two butterflies doing the nasty

74
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,350
during "CSI: Miami."

75
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,610
Wow, you two, his and her tats.

76
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,950
Romantic and will help
identify the bodies.

77
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,790
Sure, you know, matching tattoos

78
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,690
are the deepest
expression of commitment.

79
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,190
Well, matching tattoos

80
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,200
and pooping in front of each other.

81
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,630
I'm not gonna do it in front of my man.

82
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,270
I poop at McDonald's 'cause I'm a lady.

83
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,840
Thanks for the cupcake.

84
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,070
We really have to start charging her.

85
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,940
Charge her with what,
first-degree man-settling?

86
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,210
Max, as I was saying,
it's time to get serious

87
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,450
about the business.

88
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,050
Absolutely. Let's leave early.

89
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,950
What? Last night after 1:00,

90
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,950
we made only $15, right?

91
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,420
$14.63.

92
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,160
What? Math is my thing.

93
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,890
Would you roll your
eyes if you were standing

94
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,860
across from Eminem
and he started rapping?

95
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,700
Uh, yes.

96
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,270
I'd be all, "Dude, you're 60.
Sit on a porch swing."

97
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,670
Okay, look, here is $15.

98
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,940
That'll cover what we'll probably make.

99
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,440
I'm leaving.

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,080
You're just gonna leave me here?

101
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,950
Yup, I'm leaving as soon
as I get my change back

102
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,450
from that $14.63.

103
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,320
Fine, just tell me how much that is.

104
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,550
Or maybe sooner.

105
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,390
This is a very big day for me.

106
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,900
Why, because of this
totally out-of-the-blue order

107
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,960
we got to do cupcakes
for this business seminar?

108
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,600
No, the first time
I've entered a Sheridan

109
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,100
through a door.

110
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,110
Usually it's by window
or freight elevator.

111
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,510
And one time, I rolled
in under some girl's

112
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,910
quinceañera dress.

113
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,710
The seminar's about to start.

114
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,550
I have unclaimed name
tags for Pamela, Ellen...

115
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,420
What kind of losers would come to this?

116
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,450
Max, Caroline.

117
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,290
I wouldn't call us losers.

118
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,720
Are you here?

119
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,390
Okay, so there is no cupcake order.

120
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,330
I signed us up for this seminar.

121
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,170
I carried cupcakes on
a subway for nothing?

122
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:46,770
The annoying woman next to
me talked the whole time.

123
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,010
I was sitting next to you, Max.

124
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,010
Look, I knew you
wouldn't come otherwise,

125
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,840
and you need to be here.

126
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,010
This is a business intervention.

127
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,980
It's not an intervention.

128
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,950
Max, your behavior
lately has affected me

129
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,320
in the following ways.

130
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,620
I can't believe this.

131
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,490
At least in my other
interventions I was drunk.

132
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,430
We need to do this seminar.

133
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,030
Gordon Kepper is a genius.

134
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,000
He's gonna give our
business a real bump.

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,170
Guys giving me a bump
is why they threw me

136
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,870
that second intervention.

137
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,140
Let's go.

138
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,270
Oh, mm, okay. See you.

139
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,940
So this is your new thing, Max?

140
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,410
You're just gonna walk out on me?

141
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,180
Actually, it's an old thing.

142
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,950
In fact, it's kind
of a family tradition.

143
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,720
I learned from my father, whoever he is.

144
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,020
Come on. It's just two days.

145
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,260
Two days? No way.

146
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,520
No freaking way.

147
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,060
There's a buffet and a dessert bar.

148
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,590
Ooh, okay.

149
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,930
Wait here, I'll go pay.
I brought some cash.

150
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,970
And they'll take an expired
target gift card, right?

151
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,430
Oh, we are not paying.

152
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,540
Here. Here, Pamela.

153
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,210
Follow Ellen to the freight elevator.

154
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,310
No way, Max. We are not sneaking in.

155
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,080
How much is this thing? $1,000.

156
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,410
We're sneaking in, Ellen.

157
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,420
Now, you all are here today

158
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,390
not only to find out
what you are as a business

159
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,390
but to find out who you are.

160
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,390
I'm a lady hoping there's
macaroni and cheese

161
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,030
at that buffet.

162
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,400
Who are you is your brand,

163
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,930
and saying that a brand is simply a name

164
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,070
is like saying
Abraham Lincoln is simply a name,

165
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,940
or Mahatma Gandhi, God.

166
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,770
Who does this guy think he is?

167
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,640
I'm sure you're wondering,
"Who does this guy think he is?"

168
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,010
Okay, that was weird.

169
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,980
Or maybe this seems weird.

170
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,290
I've got chills.

171
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,520
When it comes to business,

172
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,890
people come up to me all the time.

173
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,760
They say, "Gordon, business is hard,

174
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,930
but I do what I can."

175
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,200
and they shrug. Now, is
that the right attitude?

176
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,130
- No.
- Yes.

177
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,940
To those people, I say,
"don't do what you can.

178
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,340
Can what you do."

179
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,540
Don't do what you can.

180
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,340
Can what you do! Get it?

181
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,380
Do you get it?

182
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,880
- Yes.
- No.

183
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,050
- You did not get it.
- Shh.

184
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,850
All right, everybody,
reach under your chairs

185
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,150
and pick up what you find there.

186
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,920
Hope it's a way out of here.

187
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,320
Koosh balls?

188
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,230
Inside those cans, you will find the key

189
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,930
to success in your business.

190
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,260
Not unless the key is
Rosie O'Donnell's career

191
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,300
before her buzz cut.

192
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,970
Truth.

193
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,840
That's the big secret to business.

194
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,970
If people buy what you're saying,

195
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,170
they will buy what you're selling.

196
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,480
Max, stay alert. This
could go to cult like that.

197
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,480
I like to think of those
things you're holding

198
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,480
as my truth balls.

199
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,260
Screw this. Let's get to the meatballs.

200
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,930
Anytime in the next two days,

201
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,660
one of you is up here
selling you something

202
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,000
that you feel is just bull,

203
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,830
Then toss it...

204
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,870
Max!

205
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,800
I mean, Ellen!

206
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,070
Yeah, baby.

207
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,810
That is what I'm talking about.

208
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,210
Whoever threw that is not afraid

209
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,180
to really go for it,

210
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,810
and that will go a long way

211
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,650
toward success in business.

212
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,880
All right, cool, but is it
a long way to the buffet?

213
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,190
'Cause I am starving.

214
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,690
Okay, everyone.

215
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,620
Consider these small
groups you've broken into

216
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,330
as little think tanks.

217
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,500
I need you to work together
and bring out your very best.

218
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,430
Max!

219
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,800
Don't blame me.

220
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,040
Blame the heavy cream
at the fettuccini bar.

221
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,310
Alfredo must be Italian for "roofie."

222
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,510
So, Ellen, tell us what you have,

223
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,440
and I'll tell you what we think.

224
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,910
Oh, Ellen. That's you.

225
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,910
Oh, oh, yes, yes, that's me.

226
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,850
I'm Ellen. Definitely an Ellen.

227
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,890
See, I dance.

228
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,090
Okay.

229
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,730
Okay. Okay, now it's weird.

230
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,900
So, Ellen...

231
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,330
Let's hear your B.B.B....

232
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,370
Your brilliant business brand.

233
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,410
Uh...

234
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,380
I-I don't do the talking.
Pamela does the talking.

235
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,750
- Pam?
- Thanks, Ellen.

236
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,350
Hello, everyone, my name is Pam Panning,

237
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,820
and what my partner,
Ellen, was trying to say is,

238
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,750
we making very beautiful
artisan cupcakes.

239
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Yeah, but they're still cool.

240
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,560
I never said they weren't cool.

241
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,630
Yeah, mm, maybe they
just didn't sound cool

242
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,060
coming out of your face.

243
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,770
I'm sorry, but at least actual words

244
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,300
are better than, "uh, uh-uh, uh..."

245
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,340
Ladies, hold.

246
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,970
Sometimes in business

247
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,110
partners' ships will sail
in two different directions,

248
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,110
so you two need to find
out if you're gonna continue

249
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,250
to sail apart or if
you're gonna change course

250
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,250
and reconvene at the port
of mutual understanding.

251
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,650
Well, we can't sail too far apart

252
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,420
'cause I'm definitely
gonna have to explain

253
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,590
what you just said to her.

254
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,330
I got it.

255
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,460
I'm a boat, and I'm trying
to get away from you.

256
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,470
Sounds right to me.

257
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,830
Think it over.

258
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,000
Talk it over with your first mate.

259
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,010
Come back tomorrow

260
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,240
and tell me who your business is,

261
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,040
and I'll help guide
you toward that purpose.

262
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,610
And remember, you
can't purpose without...

263
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,350
- Puss.
- Okay, wow.

264
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,490
Gordon, her boat's kind of
in shallow water right now,

265
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,260
but we're gonna go
away, get it together,

266
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,220
and come back and blow you away.

267
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,390
And you can't spell
"blow you away" without...

268
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,860
Our ship's leaving.

269
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,900
Oh, hello.

270
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,800
Welcome to the Williamsburg Diner.

271
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,140
Can I get you anything,
like a work ethic?

272
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,940
Han, this is adorable, but we're busy.

273
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,640
We're pitching our
business brand tomorrow,

274
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,510
and Max and I need to
get on the same page.

275
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,750
Yeah, we don't want to work here

276
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,450
the rest of our lives.

277
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,750
Well, now we're all on the same page.

278
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,220
Han, just give us ten minutes.

279
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,450
Then we'll get to work.

280
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,720
Well, I've waited four years.

281
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,320
What's another ten minutes?

282
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,730
Max, I have to say I was a little thrown

283
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,400
by that thing you said today.

284
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,230
What, that the best sex I've ever had

285
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,030
was alone on the Tilt-A-Whirl?

286
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,200
No, why would that throw me?
You say that every day.

287
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,910
No, that thing about
me not sounding cool.

288
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,110
Why would that throw
you? I say it every day.

289
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,680
Yes, but not about the business.

290
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,910
So what was it? The word "artisan"?

291
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,520
Okay, first of all, it
sounds like fart-isan,

292
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,220
as in, "a fart is in
this room right now."

293
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,190
Somebody finally called
you out on it, Caroline.

294
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,500
So I was thinking our slogan could be,

295
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,930
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes.
Sugar and spice."

296
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,540
I'd rather go with Fart-isan.

297
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,910
Really, Beavis?

298
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,040
What does your business
partner Butthead think?

299
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,480
Our business isn't working.

300
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,380
Well, guess who is working.

301
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,250
Me, the damn owner.

302
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,880
Why are you surprised?

303
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,950
You know how many
cupcakes were not selling.

304
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,290
I mean, you're secretly
eating at least six a night

305
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,160
to make me think we're selling more.

306
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,860
Also 'cause I'm sad.

307
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,000
Look, I know you went
to Wharton and all, but...

308
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,730
Wait...

309
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,470
What's happening?

310
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,240
Is this a business intervention on me?

311
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,810
From someone who pronounces

312
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,810
the word business "bidness"?

313
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,810
Why are you giving me
the big eye-painting face?

314
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,410
You knew the business wasn't working.

315
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,750
Well, I don't hear you
coming up with any ideas.

316
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,150
That's 'cause you don't listen.

317
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,850
Remember when I said
we should stop making

318
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,050
all these flowery cupcakes

319
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,650
and just make ones that say mean things

320
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,190
like "eat it" and "lick me"?

321
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,990
Your big business plan is cupcakes

322
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,100
that say "eat it" and "lick me"?

323
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,460
And other funny things like "loser"

324
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,400
or "eat your feelings."

325
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,540
Hmm, why not just
shoot people in the face

326
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,300
when they come to the window?

327
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,270
And I thought the back of our T-shirt

328
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:21,680
could just say, "cream filled."

329
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,950
So funny if, like, a
hot girl was wearing it.

330
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,980
And even funnier if it was a fat guy.

331
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,750
Okay, maybe like Gordon said,

332
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,590
our partner ships are going
in different directions.

333
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,420
My sugar and spice
ship is going one way,

334
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,190
and your mean and ugly booze cruise

335
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,790
is going another.

336
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,430
So how about tomorrow,
I'll sail my ship,

337
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,800
and you can sail yours, Ellen.

338
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,330
Done.

339
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,500
And, Pam, I know you
think your ship don't sink,

340
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,340
but it does.

341
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,300
So, Hannah, Todd, go.

342
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,770
Tell us, who is your business?

343
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,370
We make guitar case suitcases.

344
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,910
Yeah, they're suitcases
that look like guitar cases

345
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,450
so you can look cool at the airport.

346
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,250
So far, no truth balls.

347
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,590
That means we believe
you're telling some truth

348
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,890
of who you are.

349
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,390
Business is always...

350
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,590
Okay then.

351
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,090
So what, their big idea

352
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,290
is just throwing your
crap in a guitar case?

353
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,230
Well, it's no fart-isan cupcake.

354
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,970
Todd, Hannah, did you get
together with our graphic artist

355
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,130
to help create a logo?

356
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,600
Yes, we did.

357
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,040
We stayed up all
night, and to be honest,

358
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,640
it got kind of weird.

359
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,280
That's our logo,

360
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,050
and our company's called
"I'm With the Band."

361
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,290
Back off!

362
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,960
She just got out of rehab.

363
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,530
Business is not for the faint of heart

364
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,660
or coke addicts.

365
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,130
Next up, we've got Ellen and Pam.

366
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,060
Let's give 'em some love.

367
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,570
Max, you're really not gonna go up there

368
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,130
and sell your idea as a business plan.

369
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,740
Yup, and I feel pretty good about it.

370
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,840
Okay, well, then I hope
you enjoy lots of balls

371
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,010
in your face.

372
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,710
If I didn't at Burning Man,

373
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,510
I doubt I will here.

374
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,510
Gordon, hi.

375
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,150
As you predicted,

376
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,720
today we'll be presenting
our brands separately.

377
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,850
Okay, looks like we have
us a brand off, folks.

378
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,290
This is exciting.

379
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:37,090
I am feeling it!

380
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,030
Ellen, I know you're
not used to being alone.

381
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,730
Neither was I, hence wife number three.

382
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,030
Don't rush.

383
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,870
Take some time to get yourself centered.

384
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,500
Yo, yo, yo!
What's happening, Sheridan!

385
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,870
Ellen in the house.

386
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,240
Let me hear some noise.

387
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Yeah. Oh! All right, all right.

388
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,810
We got some haters. That's cool.

389
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,750
Ellen, did you design a logo?

390
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,690
Sure did. Show it, player.

391
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,660
George, she's talking to you.

392
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,560
Oh, good impact.

393
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,190
Boom, cupcake business.

394
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,460
But, um...

395
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,460
Where's the name of your business?

396
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,600
Oh, I didn't want one.

397
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,430
I just wanted it to be cool.

398
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,540
So let me get this correct.

399
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,640
You want to make
T-shirts for your business

400
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,580
with no business connection.

401
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,010
Okay.

402
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,750
This is your journey,
but it might end here.

403
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,620
No, no, no, see, it's a cupcake,

404
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,550
and we sell cupcakes,
so that's the "bidness."

405
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,660
Okay, you know what? Screw this!

406
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,360
That t-shirt is way cool,
and if you can't see it,

407
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,630
this seminar is so not
worth the $1,000 I paid.

408
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,270
Peace out.

409
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,410
In business, we call that a meltdown.

410
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,240
It happens.

411
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,810
So why don't we bring up
Ellen's former partner Pam.

412
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,810
Let's give Pam a round of applause.

413
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,750
Max, I don't have to go up there.

414
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,020
Come on, we can just leave.

415
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,390
Oh, look who wants

416
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,450
to pack up their guitar suitcase and go.

417
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,760
You know what?

418
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,160
I was only leaving 'cause you failed.

419
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,130
I believe in my ideas.

420
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,030
Good afternoon. Hello, hi.

421
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,270
I represent Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

422
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm gonna stop you right there.

423
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,740
Why Max's cupcakes?

424
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,840
Why not Ellen's or Pam's?

425
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,670
Well, um...

426
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,810
Max was... Max is this
very special person

427
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,810
and the inspiration
behind our whole business.

428
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,980
Got it.

429
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,320
So Max is an emotional touchstone

430
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,780
for you and your business.

431
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,390
Yes.

432
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,720
Valid. Go on.

433
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,990
Great.

434
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,520
So the logo...

435
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,660
George.

436
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,600
This is our current company logo,

437
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,330
And I feel it works just fine.

438
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,870
I mean, if it ain't
broke, don't fix it, right?

439
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,100
Okay.

440
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,370
Well, the cupcake shows
a mix of sweet imagery

441
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,880
because we're two girls trying
to retro-repurpose the phrase

442
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,850
"sugar and spice and everything nice."

443
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,680
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

444
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,080
Leave Pam alone!

445
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,650
I'm fine, Ellen.

446
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,350
They can't shut me down,
because I believe in us

447
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,690
and our special brand
of artisan cupcakes.

448
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,260
Why?

449
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,430
Give me!

450
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:35,970
Eat it, you losers! Eat it, eat it!

451
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,070
I see the truth balls have stopped.

452
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,680
It looks like "eat it,
eat it, you losers,"

453
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,850
might just be your brand.

454
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,420
You two are a combination
of sugar and spice

455
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,520
and things not so nice.

456
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,320
Speaking of truth, I need you
to pay Sandra for the seminar.

457
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,390
As much as I admire your pluck,

458
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,100
12 trips to the pasta bar aren't free.

459
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,100
- Come on, Pam.
- Yeah, let's go, Ellen.

460
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,730
I'm Ellen.

461
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,570
Guess what I have under my coat.

462
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,880
Well, I know it's not a boob reduction.

463
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,650
What do you think? Cool, huh?

464
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,820
Aw, man, somebody already makes that?

465
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,380
Oh, bummer.

466
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,020
This is like when I thought
I invented chip-wiches.

467
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,760
Should've known. I was
eating one at the time.

468
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,790
No, Max, this is your shirt.

469
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,430
I got the rendering from the seminar

470
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,690
and had it made that.

471
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,930
We can make anything in under an hour.

472
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,500
You know, that place under the bridge

473
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,830
near the underage bar
where you got under arrest.

474
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,370
No way.

475
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,070
Oh, no way. That's hot.

476
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,110
I know, and a girl at the place

477
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,910
asked me where she could get one.

478
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,140
Really?

479
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,510
Kind of in love with myself right now.

480
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,610
Hey, what made you change
your mind about the T-shirts?

481
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,250
Well, one of the things
I learned at Wharton

482
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,350
is that success depends on staying open

483
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,790
to a better idea,
even if it's not yours.

484
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,960
- Aw.
- And here.

485
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,990
I thought you'd rather a black one.

486
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:09,400
On Tinder and in life.
