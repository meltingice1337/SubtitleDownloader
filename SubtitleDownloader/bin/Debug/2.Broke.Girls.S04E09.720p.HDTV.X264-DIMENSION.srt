Okay, everybody, gather 'round.

Who knew it was "bring your
girlfriend to work" day?

00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:12,642
She is not my girlfriend.

00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:14,177
Judy is a CPR doll,

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,680
and the hardest-working
girl in this diner.

6
00:00:17,682 --> 00:00:21,951
Oh, Han, you shouldn't bring
your sex doll out in public.

7
00:00:21,953 --> 00:00:26,022
This is not my girlfriend or a sex doll!

8
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:27,657
Earl, come over.

9
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:30,126
We're going to use Judy to
learn how to resuscitate.

10
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:32,795
I have a "do not resuscitate" clause,

11
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:36,165
as in, I do not resuscitate others.

13
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:38,901
What's up, Han?

14
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:40,403
Oh, hey, Judy.

15
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:44,640
How do you know Judy?

16
00:00:44,642 --> 00:00:48,844
With a torso like that, she gets around.

17
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:51,313
Okay, I will demonstrate.

18
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:52,848
Oh, no!

19
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,885
Judy's choking on something!

20
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:58,721
Well, we know it's not you.

21
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:02,358
First you have to tilt the head back

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,693
and clear the airway and blow.

Oh, Max, I think we're witnessing

25
00:01:07,598 --> 00:01:10,799
his first kiss.

26
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:13,736
Fourth, thank you very much.

27
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:16,705
Han, why are you wasting
your time kissing her?

28
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:17,940
She doesn't have any arms.

29
00:01:17,942 --> 00:01:19,742
Just go for it.

Caroline, I thought you would be crying.

Tears on your birthday
have become as expected

I don't believe in birthdays.

You're only as old as you feel.

Caroline, are we still on
for Two Boots pizza tonight?

50
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:24,115
I'm closing the diner early
in honor of your birthday,

Absolutely, Han.

or two slices with one topping,

56
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:36,494
and my birthday cake is a free flan

Okay, everybody.

00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:51,375
I have two announcements,

First, the guy who found
the beak in his sandwich

63
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:57,948
is not suing, and second,

64
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,186
I'm gonna pop the question to Sophie.

65
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:04,655
Well, you've already
popped everything else.

66
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:08,526
What do you think?

67
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,728
They say diamonds are
a girl's best friend.

68

Oh, really?

69
00:03:11,964 --> 00:03:13,297
I thought a girl's best friend

70
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,399
was someone just a
little fatter than her.

71
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:18,002
It was my grandma's from Russia.

72
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:19,804
I had my cousin Svela swallow it

73
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:21,906
to bring it to America.

Is Sophie expecting it?

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,226
Of course.

00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:43,494
She doesn't like surprises

81
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:45,329
since her family barn was torched

82
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:48,532

00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:52,302
Hi, I have a delivery
for Caroline Channing

from Martin Channing.

Oh, it's a birthday gift from my daddy

87
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:57,441
Last year, he made me

00:03:57,443 --> 00:04:00,210
a macaroni art picture frame.

89
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:02,779
I mean, the man once rented Miami

90
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:05,682

91
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:09,519
Hey, that picture frame
fed us for two days.

92
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:11,154
Yeah, well, this thing is not pasta,

93
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:13,223
and it's too big to
fit through the door.

94
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:16,126
And so was I three months ago.

00:04:16,128 --> 00:04:17,561

00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:36,680
Is that <i>my</i> Lamborghini?

103

Yeah, it's a Lamborghini
Aventador Roadster.

00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:42,685
Wow.

has gotten pretty fancy.

106

Well, it takes four years for
these cars to be custom-made.

107
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:51,194
This one was ordered in 2011.

108
00:04:51,196 --> 00:04:53,029
That's right, my father
ordered this for me

109
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:54,597
when he still had money.

110
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:58,101
Correction: When he had
everyone else's money.

111
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:02,338

was that one iffy chromosome.

Well, here you go.

00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:06,643
It's all yours.

the Batmobile white.

Can't we have anything?

121
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:39,606
That's a $450,000 sports car.

00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,876

134

Now, this is the kind of car

141

00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:06,726
Well, everyone away from the car.

153
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:08,094
I just got off the phone with my dad.

154
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:09,929
The car is being seized in the morning.

155
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:12,365
Turns out they won't
let me keep my present.

156
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:13,633
It's just like my eighth birthday

157
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:17,269
when they made me
return Mccaulay Culkin.

158
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,778
They bought you a boy?

159
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,280
You were rich.

160
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,750
Oh, boy, the car's right here,
and you can't even use it.

161
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:35,287
That's like me
having you two for waitresses.

162
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,294
Caroline, can I ask you a favor?

163
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,331
You're not using
the car to propose to Sophie.

164
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,199
You heard how much she liked it.

165
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,835
And it's a little bit
classier than my original plan:

166
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:53,038
dinner and a cock fight in Yonkers.

167
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,340
Not that I'm listening,

168
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:59,811
but I'm not gonna get
proposed to at a gay bar.

169
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:04,082
Great, now my gay bar idea is out also.

170
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,617
No, Oleg.

171
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,686
I can't return the car
with scratches, dents,

172
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:10,922
or chlamydia.

173
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,658
But we can still drive it, right?

174
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,260
I mean, I've been on that cream
for like a month.

175
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,201
Max, what is the ninth rule
of the Lamborghini Club?

176
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,837
No red drinks in the car.

177
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,739
Here's my number one rule:

178
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,474
If you're going to make me sleep in it,

179
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,977
I am going to drink in it.

180
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,378
Well, just be careful.

181
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,813
I only have one Clorox wipe

182
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,982
that has to last till my next birthday,

183
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,484
and it's already lost
a lot of its moisture.

184
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,489
I don't see why we
have to just sit here.

185
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,657
We can't drive it.

186
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,459
My dad said if anything happens to it,

187
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,693
we'll be responsible.

188
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,095
What could possibly happen

189
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:53,798
on a weed run to deep Tijuana?

190
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,567
You know, I wish this car never came,

191
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,168
and I wish I never sat in it.

192
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,903
It's the same reason
I don't go to Barneys.

193
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,506
I don't like to be around
things I can't afford anymore.

194
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:04,776
Same reason I don't go
to the 99 Cent Store.

195
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,277
There's a Nerf tennis set

196
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,580
half on the floor, half in the bin,

197
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:11,649
none of it going home with me.

198
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,385
I was trying to be positive
about my birthday this year,

199
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,055
but, Max, if things hadn't
happened with my father,

200
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,257
tonight would have been
a magical birthday for me.

201
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,925
Hey, there was some magic.

202
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,929
I personally made
five vodka Sprites disappear.

203
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,064
Ta-da!

204
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,734
I would've got in the car and
driven out to the Hamptons,

205
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,569
and we'd sit on the beach all night

206
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,704
having lobster caught
by one of the townies

207
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,941
and drink champagne while
taking duckface selfies

208
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,743
till the sun came up.

209
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:44,348
FYI, I'm the townie in this scenario,

210
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,450
and I hate all of you.

211
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,720
Instead of doing any of that,
I'm having the worst birthday.

212
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,389
I probably feel worse
than Demi Moore did

213
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,558
when she turned 50.

214
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,027
Yes, just go to sleep.

215
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,430
You'll feel better
tomorrow when you wake up.

216
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,098
I mean, if that guy with the switchblade

217
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,300
doesn't come back like
he promised he would.

218
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:11,242
Caroline.

219
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,509
Caroline, wake up.

220
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,479
[water crashing]

221
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,547
We're at the beach.

222
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,217
I drove us out to the Hamptons.

223
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,753
Happy birthday!

224
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:27,224
We're in the Hamptons?

225
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,794
[shouting]
We're in the Hamptons?

226
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,830
How are we in the Hamptons?

227
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,665
How long have I been sleeping?

228
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,467
Three hours, give or take.

229
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,203
You farted twice.

230
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,004
How did I not wake up?

231
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:43,173
I know.
It was pretty bad.

232
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,212
After that last one, I thought
we were going through Egg Town.

233
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:52,883
Max, you did it again.

234
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,618
You roofied me, didn't you?

235
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,787
Of course I did.

236
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,256
You were crying and
babbling about the Hamptons,

237
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,725
so I had to put you down.

238
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,860
You promised you wouldn't again.

239
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:05,929
The last time, I was out for two days.

240
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,398
Yeah, I really just needed
to get through <i>Game of Thrones</i>

241
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,868
without someone talking
during the incest.

242
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:16,273
What is wrong with you?

243
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,242
Have you got a pen and paper?

244
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:21,144
You knew I didn't want to do this.

245
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:24,648
You never want to do
anything, so I did it for you.

246
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,051
You took a $450,000 car,

247
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:31,521
a car we're not even
supposed to be touching,

248
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:33,823
on a joyride to the Hamptons?

249
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:37,293
You wanted to be here.

250
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:38,361
You are here.

251
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:39,596
Just enjoy it.

252
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,599
I can't enjoy it.

253
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:45,301
Scotty to the bridge.

254
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:46,569
This is Captain Kirk.

255
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,238
Scotty to the bridge.

256
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:55,345
You drove over the
dunes and onto the beach?

257
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,413
Not intentionally.

258
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:59,549
I tried to stop it,
but this car was like,

259
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:01,417
"Mm, no, girl."

260
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:05,321
Oh, my God.

261
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:07,724
Did it get any scratches?

262
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:11,394
Max, get out of the car, and
help me look for scratches.

263
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:15,832
You said you were more
fun in the Hamptons.

264
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,134
Not true.

265
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:23,039
Mr. Sulu, fire all phasers.

266
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,908
No scratches.
The Lamborghini is fine.

267
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,278
But thanks to you, I'm a Rent-A-Wreck.

268
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:34,283
Come on, we have to get this car back.

269
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:36,052
We will. Jeez, relax.

270
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:37,253
We still have time.

271
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:39,622
Look, you said you wanted to be here.

272
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:41,323
You're here, and we are not leaving

273
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:42,658
till you do something beach-y,

274
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,627
like walk in the water

275
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:49,064
or find a half-eaten lady from <i>Jaws.</i>

276
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,467
No. No way.
Let's go.

277
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:52,701
Just take off your shoes or something.

278
00:12:52,703 --> 00:12:54,136
No.

279
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:55,804
Just take off your
shoes and feel the sand.

280
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:57,006
Max!
Max, stop.

281
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,707
I haven't had a proper pedicure

282
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:00,976
since Justin Timberlake
released a single.

283
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:03,712
There.
Now move your foot around.

284
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:05,047
No.

285
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:06,982
No. No! No.

286
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:08,450
Oh. Oh, yeah.

287
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:11,053
That feels nice.

288
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:13,021
The cold sand between my toes.

289
00:13:13,023 --> 00:13:14,390
But, Max, don't look.

290
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:16,458
That middle nail's a horror show.

291
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,726
Too late.

292
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:21,897
I thought it was a
pistachio for a second.

293
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,666
Max, how much do you love the beach?

294
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:26,835
I don't know.
I've never been to one.

295
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:28,737
You've never been to a beach?

296
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:30,339
No. What's the point?

297
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:32,274
I don't own a metal detector.

298
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:37,145
Well, time's up.

299
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:38,747
But we just sat down.

300
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:40,348
I know, but if we leave right now,

301
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,384
we'll still have enough
time to blow through

302
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:43,719
a McDonald's drive-through

303
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:46,888
like something from <i>Back to the Future.</i>

304
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,890
Well, I'm gonna write
our names in the sand

305
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:50,525
'cause it was a really nice thing

306
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:52,060
for you to drug me, kidnap me,

307
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:54,963
and steal my car to get me out here.

308
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:58,333
Hey, we're friends.

309
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:00,635
All right, I'll just
turn this baby around.

310
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:04,639
[engine revving]

311
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:05,840
Uh-oh.

312
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:10,412
What's "uh-oh"?

313
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:13,214
What is "uh-oh"?

314
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:15,517
Are we stuck in the sand?

315
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,421
You have correctly identified
the meaning of "uh-oh."

316
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:22,357
I love that we don't need full sentences

317
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:24,993
to communicate anymore.

318
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,786
Try it again.

319
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:36,322
[engine revving]

320
00:14:36,324 --> 00:14:37,356
Nope.

321
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:40,693
I've had less trouble
getting out of athlete's apartments.

322
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:42,628
Well, you're gonna have
to get out and push.

323
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,363
Why do I have to push?

324
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:47,333
Because you're the one who
drugged me, kidnapped me,

325
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:48,568
and stole my car.

326
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,303
Exactly.

327
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:52,905
I've already done
the lion's share of the work.

328
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:54,774
And it's our car.

329
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:56,442
Fine, I'll do it.
[engine stops]

330
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:01,314
Door's up, Lieutenant Uhura.

331
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:05,084
It stopped being funny
when we got stuck.

332
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:06,752
God, don't worry.

333
00:15:06,754 --> 00:15:08,454
I got a 600-pound woman

334
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:10,389
out of a booth at the
diner with my bare hands.

335
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:11,824
I'm fearless.

336
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:16,195
Toss her in neutral like
I did with that lady.

337
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:18,497
Sand and heels.
Not a good combo.

338
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:21,233
Not a good combo.
Not a good combo.

339
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:23,702
Oh, all right.

340
00:15:23,704 --> 00:15:26,005
All right.

341
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:26,939
I'm gonna floor it.

342
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:28,207
[engine revs]

343
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,241
On the count of three.

344
00:15:29,243 --> 00:15:31,076
One, two...

345
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:34,246
[engine revving]

346
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,655
I got excited.
I went early.

347
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:47,126
If I had a dime for
every time I heard that,

348
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:49,061
I could buy this car.

349
00:15:49,063 --> 00:15:50,929
All right, let's try again.

350
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:52,731
One, two...

351
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:55,901
[engine revving]

352
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:07,212
[coughs]

353
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:09,848
Okay, that was on purpose.

354
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,718
A little bit.

355
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,219
I can't believe it.

356
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:15,921
I can't believe that I can't believe it,

357
00:16:15,923 --> 00:16:18,090
but I really can't believe it.

358
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:19,724
We are in very big trouble,

359
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:23,061
and we're not even in the good Hamptons.

360
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:25,830
I was trying to do something nice.

361
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:28,900
First time, last time.

362
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:30,769
You know what you are?

363
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:32,437
You are reckless.

364
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:34,272
You know, all this time,

365
00:16:34,274 --> 00:16:37,175
I thought you were a
ride-or-die kind of bitch.

366
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:43,014
I am a ride-or-die kind of bitch.

367
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:45,016
What's a ride-or-die kind of bitch?

368
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:50,688
Are you Googling
"ride-or-die kind of bitch"?

369
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,459
I would be, but I only have two bars.

370
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:55,460
[sighs]

371
00:16:55,462 --> 00:16:58,162
Look, we have two options:

372
00:16:58,164 --> 00:17:02,100
Get the car out of the sand,
or let the tide take us.

373
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:04,102
Put a pin in that tide thing,

374
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:06,571
'cause I like the sound of it.

375
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:08,873
We barely have enough time
to get this car back to the city,

376
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,275
or we owe $450,000.

377
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:15,880
And I only have $3,
and 2 of it's in nickels.

378
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:17,415
Now get in the car.

379
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,117
You're hoarding nickels,

380
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,421
and I'm walking out of the 99 Cent Store
empty-handed?

381
00:17:23,423 --> 00:17:26,057
Now I'm mad.

382
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:27,892
Get ready.

383
00:17:27,894 --> 00:17:29,327
What are you doing?

384
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:31,062
I'm pushing us out of here.

385
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:32,997
[engine turns over, revs]

386
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:37,401
Because I'm a ride-or-die kind of bitch!

387
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:39,870
I think.

388
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:41,138
[grunts]

389
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,173
Now hit it!

390
00:17:42,175 --> 00:17:45,342
[engine revving]

391
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:54,752
What'd you do?
Fart us out of the ditch?

392
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:58,556
Seriously, Caroline, step on it.

393
00:17:58,558 --> 00:17:59,990
No, Max.

394
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:01,959
We can't risk getting into an accident.

395
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:05,162
What if it's not fatal?

396
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:08,399
Driving a Lamborghini slow
is like going to Red Lobster

397
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:11,068
and not getting
the Cheddar Bay biscuits.

398
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,337
Come on, we got to enjoy
this car while we can.

399
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:15,005
Hit the gas.
All right.

400
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:17,441
I'll take it up to the top
of my age dating window.

401
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:19,042
40.

402
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,944
And I'll take it to the top of mine.

403
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,246
80! [engine revving]

404
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:23,480
Let go.
Have some fun.

405
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:24,715
No, don't push on my leg!

406
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:26,850
Don't push on my...
[screaming]

407
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:29,987
Yes! Yes!

408
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:32,322
Best birthday ever!

409
00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:34,158
Should we Thelma and Louise it?

410
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,260
You mean drive over a cliff?

411
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:39,296
No, I mean wear
sunglasses and hold hands.

412
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:40,564
They drive over a cliff?

413
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:42,165
I never saw the end.

414
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:54,077
There they are.

415
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,380
Did you girls get the car back
in time this morning?

416
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:58,782
Yep, just in time, thanks to Caroline.

417
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:00,650
She was ignoring speed limit signs

418
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:03,987
like she does homeless people.

419
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:05,522
A state trooper called my driving

420
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:08,091
criminally negligent.

421
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:10,227
I was so proud.

422
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:11,695
I might've even gotten emotional,

423
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:13,396
but I had to talk our
way out of the ticket,

424
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:15,465
and I like to be professional
when my shirt's off.

425
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:17,267
[chuckles]

426
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:18,935
You didn't get a ticket?

427
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:23,039
Yesterday, I got arrested
for just walking into Whole Foods.

428
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,742
I can't believe I still
have sand in my hair.

429
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:27,877
If the only place you still
have sand is in your hair,

430
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:29,279
you're lucky.

431
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:32,615
I'm about to make a pearl down there.

432
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:37,320
Oh, hey, there, destitute Barbie.

433
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:41,090
Sorry you lost the dream car.

434
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:43,693
Anyway, I'll be in my booth.

435
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:49,065
Sophie, beautiful baby...

436
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,367
I've narrowed down
the site of my proposal

437
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,902
to three options:

438
00:19:52,904 --> 00:19:55,138
A, the place we met...

439
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,175
B, the place we've had sex most often...

440
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:02,979
or C, the place we've
had sex most recently.

441
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:07,283
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

442
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:11,554
All three of those
places are this booth!

443
00:20:13,523 --> 00:20:15,791
That's right.

444
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:17,727
Sophie Kachinsky...

445
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:19,895
He's proposing at the diner?

446
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:23,399
What's he gonna do?
Put an onion ring on it?

447
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:27,670
[inhales sharply]

448
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:30,039
Oh...

449
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,075
I love that.

450
00:20:38,014 --> 00:20:41,183
You know, I was planning on saying no

451
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:45,321
and making you beg
for a few hours, but...

452
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:47,857
I just love you too much.

453
00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:57,433
Aw, that's so not as gross as normal.

454
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,240
Now it is.
